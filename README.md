# Weatherforecasting_webapp_proj
This project is a Weather Forecasting Web Application that allows users to check real-time weather information for any city in the world. It includes a simple login system, a clean dashboard, and a responsive layout that works on both mobile and desktop.

After logging in, the user can search for any city, and the app instantly shows:

🌡 Temperature (°C)

💧 Humidity (%)

🌬 Wind Direction (°)

🔵 Atmospheric Pressure (hPa)

📍 City Name


The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time and accurate weather data. When the user enters a city name, the JavaScript code sends a request to the weather API and updates the dashboard with the latest weather conditions.

This project demonstrates:

✔ HTML for structure
✔ CSS for design and layout
✔ JavaScript for fetching live weather data
✔ PHP for backend handling
✔ API integration
✔ Fetch() method for making web requests
✔ Login validation
✔ Dynamic content updates

Overall, this Weather Forecast App is a beginner-friendly but powerful project that shows how real-world weather applications work by combining frontend, API communication, and functional user interface design.
